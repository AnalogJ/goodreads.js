First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce-- and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine--and what he will become is far stranger.</description>\n<authors>\n<author>\n<id>4763</id>\n<name>John Scalzi</name>\n<role></role>\n<image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p5/4763.jpg]]>\n</image_url>\n<small_image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p2/4763.jpg]]>\n</small_image_url>\n<link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4763.John_Scalzi]]></link>\n<average_rating>4.00</average_rating>\n<ratings_count>429758</ratings_count>\n<text_reviews_count>34807</text_reviews_count>\n</author>\n</authors>\n  <published>2007</published>\n</book>\n\n    <book>\n  <id type=\"integer\">13055592</id>\n  <isbn>0765316994</isbn>\n  <isbn13>9780765316998</isbn13>\n  <text_reviews_count type=\"integer\">6418</text_reviews_count>\n  <title>Redshirts</title>\n  <title_without_series>Redshirts</title_without_series>\n  <image_url>https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png</image_url>\n  <small_image_url>https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png</small_image_url>\n  <large_image_url/>\n  <link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13055592-redshirts</link>\n  <num_pages>320</num_pages>\n  <format></format>\n  <edition_information/>\n  <publisher>Tor Books</publisher>\n  <publication_day></publication_day>\n  <publication_year></publication_year>\n  <publication_month></publication_month>\n  <average_rating>3.83</average_rating>\n  <ratings_count>58263</ratings_count>\n  <description>Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the Universal Union Capital Ship &lt;i&gt;Intrepid&lt;/i&gt;, flagship of the Universal Union since the year 2456. It’s a prestige posting, and Andrew is thrilled all the more to be assigned to the ship’s Xenobiology laboratory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life couldn’t be better…until Andrew begins to pick up on the fact that: &lt;br /&gt;(1) every Away Mission involves some kind of lethal confrontation with alien forces &lt;br /&gt;(2) the ship’s captain, its chief science officer, and the handsome Lieutenant Kerensky always survive these confrontations &lt;br /&gt;(3) at least one low-ranked crew member is, sadly, always killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly, a great deal of energy below decks is expended on avoiding, at all costs, being assigned to an Away Mission. Then Andrew stumbles on information that completely transforms his and his colleagues’ understanding of what the starship &lt;i&gt;Intrepid&lt;/i&gt; really is…and offers them a crazy, high-risk chance to save their own lives.</description>\n<authors>\n<author>\n<id>4763</id>\n<name>John Scalzi</name>\n<role></role>\n<image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p5/4763.jpg]]>\n</image_url>\n<small_image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p2/4763.jpg]]>\n</small_image_url>\n<link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4763.John_Scalzi]]></link>\n<average_rating>4.00</average_rating>\n<ratings_count>429758</ratings_count>\n<text_reviews_count>34807</text_reviews_count>\n</author>\n</authors>\n  <published></published>\n</book>\n\n    <book>\n  <id type=\"integer\">239399</id>\n  <isbn>0765354063</isbn>\n  <isbn13>9780765354068</isbn13>\n  <text_reviews_count type=\"integer\">1895</text_reviews_count>\n  <title>The Ghost Brigades (Old Man's War, #2)</title>\n  <title_without_series>The Ghost Brigades</title_without_series>\n  <image_url>https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403295928m/239399.jpg</image_url>\n  <small_image_url>https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403295928s/239399.jpg</small_image_url>\n  <large_image_url/>\n  <link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239399.The_Ghost_Brigades</link>\n  <num_pages>347</num_pages>\n  <format></format>\n  <edition_information/>\n  <publisher></publisher>\n  <publication_day></publication_day>\n  <publication_year></publication_year>\n  <publication_month></publication_month>\n  <average_rating>4.09</average_rating>\n  <ratings_count>44702</ratings_count>\n  <description>The Ghost Brigades are the Special Forces of the Colonial Defense Forces, elite troops created from the DNA of the dead and turned into the perfect soldiers for the CDF's toughest operations. They’re young, they’re fast and strong, and they’re totally without normal human qualms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The universe is a dangerous place for humanity—and it's about to become far more dangerous. Three races that humans have clashed with before have allied to halt our expansion into space. Their linchpin: the turncoat military scientist Charles Boutin, who knows the CDF’s biggest military secrets. To prevail, the CDF must find out why Boutin did what he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jared Dirac is the only human who can provide answers -- a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin's DNA, Jared’s brain should be able to access Boutin's electronic memories. But when the memory transplant appears to fail, Jared is given to the Ghost Brigades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Jared is a perfect soldier, but as Boutin’s memories slowly surface, Jared begins to intuit the reason’s for Boutin’s betrayal. As Jared desperately hunts for his \"father,\" he must also come to grips with his own choices. Time is running out: The alliance is preparing its offensive, and some of them plan worse things than humanity’s mere military defeat…</description>\n<authors>\n<author>\n<id>4763</id>\n<name>John Scalzi</name>\n<role></role>\n<image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p5/4763.jpg]]>\n</image_url>\n<small_image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p2/4763.jpg]]>\n</small_image_url>\n<link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4763.John_Scalzi]]></link>\n<average_rating>4.00</average_rating>\n<ratings_count>429758</ratings_count>\n<text_reviews_count>34807</text_reviews_count>\n</author>\n</authors>\n  <published></published>\n</book>\n\n    <book>\n  <id type=\"integer\">88071</id>\n  <isbn>0765316978</isbn>\n  <isbn13>9780765316974</isbn13>\n  <text_reviews_count type=\"integer\">1311</text_reviews_count>\n  <title>The Last Colony (Old Man's War #3)</title>\n  <title_without_series>The Last Colony</title_without_series>\n  <image_url>https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png</image_url>\n  <small_image_url>https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png</small_image_url>\n  <large_image_url/>\n  <link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88071.The_Last_Colony</link>\n  <num_pages></num_pages>\n  <format></format>\n  <edition_information/>\n  <publisher></publisher>\n  <publication_day></publication_day>\n  <publication_year></publication_year>\n  <publication_month></publication_month>\n  <average_rating>4.03</average_rating>\n  <ratings_count>33604</ratings_count>\n  <description>Retired from his fighting days, John Perry is now village ombudsman for a human colony on distant Huckleberry.

Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the United States alone - the disease causes \"Lock In\": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as \"Haden's syndrome,\" rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an \"integrator\" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But \"complicated\" doesn't begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. The world of the locked in is changing, and with the change comes opportunities that the ambitious will seize at any cost. The investigation that began as a murder case takes Shane and Vann from the halls of corporate power to the virtual spaces of the locked in, and to the very heart of an emerging, surprising new human culture. It's nothing you could have expected.</description>\n<authors>\n<author>\n<id>4763</id>\n<name>John Scalzi</name>\n<role></role>\n<image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p5/4763.jpg]]>\n</image_url>\n<small_image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p2/4763.jpg]]>\n</small_image_url>\n<link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4763.John_Scalzi]]></link>\n<average_rating>4.00</average_rating>\n<ratings_count>429758</ratings_count>\n<text_reviews_count>34807</text_reviews_count>\n</author>\n</authors>\n  <published>2014</published>\n</book>\n\n    <book>\n  <id type=\"integer\">9647532</id>\n  <isbn>0765328542</isbn>\n  <isbn13>9780765328540</isbn13>\n  <text_reviews_count type=\"integer\">1572</text_reviews_count>\n  <title>Fuzzy Nation</title>\n  <title_without_series>Fuzzy Nation</title_without_series>\n  <image_url>https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1316132345m/9647532.jpg</image_url>\n  <small_image_url>https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1316132345s/9647532.jpg</small_image_url>\n  <large_image_url/>\n  <link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9647532-fuzzy-nation</link>\n  <num_pages>303</num_pages>\n  <format></format>\n  <edition_information/>\n  <publisher></publisher>\n  <publication_day></publication_day>\n  <publication_year></publication_year>\n  <publication_month></publication_month>\n  <average_rating>4.09</average_rating>\n  <ratings_count>17938</ratings_count>\n  <description>Jack Holloway works alone, for reasons he doesn't care to talk about. Hundreds of miles from ZaraCorp's headquarters on planet, 178 light-years from the corporation's headquarters on Earth, Jack is content as an independent contractor, prospecting and surveying at his own pace. As for his past, that's not up for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, in the wake of an accidental cliff collapse, Jack discovers a seam of unimaginably valuable jewels, to which he manages to lay legal claim just as ZaraCorp is cancelling their contract with him for his part in causing the collapse. Briefly in the catbird seat, legally speaking, Jack pressures ZaraCorp into recognizing his claim, and cuts them in as partners to help extract the wealth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there's another wrinkle to ZaraCorp's relationship with the planet Zarathustra. Their entire legal right to exploit the verdant Earth-like planet, the basis of the wealth they derive from extracting its resources, is based on being able to certify to the authorities on Earth that Zarathustra is home to no sentient species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a small furry biped—trusting, appealing, and ridiculously cute—shows up at Jack's outback home. Followed by its family. As it dawns on Jack that despite their stature, these are people, he begins to suspect that ZaraCorp's claim to a planet's worth of wealth is very flimsy indeed…and that ZaraCorp may stop at nothing to eliminate the \"fuzzys\" before their existence becomes more widely known.</description>\n<authors>\n<author>\n<id>4763</id>\n<name>John Scalzi</name>\n<role></role>\n<image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p5/4763.jpg]]>\n</image_url>\n<small_image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p2/4763.jpg]]>\n</small_image_url>\n<link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4763.John_Scalzi]]></link>\n<average_rating>4.00</average_rating>\n<ratings_count>429758</ratings_count>\n<text_reviews_count>34807</text_reviews_count>\n</author>\n</authors>\n  <published></published>\n</book>\n\n    <book>\n  <id type=\"integer\">2102600</id>\n  <isbn>0765316986</isbn>\n  <isbn13>9780765316981</isbn13>\n  <text_reviews_count type=\"integer\">1014</text_reviews_count>\n  <title>Zoe's Tale (Old Man's War, #4)</title>\n  <title_without_series>Zoe's Tale</title_without_series>\n  <image_url>https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1301108028m/2102600.jpg</image_url>\n  <small_image_url>https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1301108028s/2102600.jpg</small_image_url>\n  <large_image_url/>\n  <link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2102600.Zoe_s_Tale</link>\n  <num_pages>335</num_pages>\n  <format></format>\n  <edition_information/>\n  <publisher></publisher>\n  <publication_day></publication_day>\n  <publication_year></publication_year>\n  <publication_month></publication_month>\n  <average_rating>3.73</average_rating>\n  <ratings_count>18333</ratings_count>\n  <description>How do you tell your part in the biggest tale in history?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ask because it's what I have to do.

Witness to history. Friend. Daughter. Human. Seventeen years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone on Earth knows the tale I am part of.

I'm going to tell it to you now, the only way I know how: not straight but true, the whole thing, to try make you feel what I felt: the joy and terror and uncertainty, panic and wonder, despair and hope. Everything that happened, bringing us to Earth, and Earth out of its captivity. All through my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a story you know.

For generations the CU had defended humanity against hostile aliens, deliberately keeping Earth an ignorant backwater and a source of military recruits. Now the CU’s secrets are known to all. Other alien races have come on the scene and formed a new alliance—an alliance against the Colonial Union. And they’ve invited the people of Earth to join them. For a shaken and betrayed Earth, the choice isn't obvious or easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against such possibilities, managing the survival of the Colonial Union won’t be easy, either. It will take diplomatic finesse, political cunning…and a brilliant “B Team,” centered on the resourceful Lieutenant Harry Wilson, that can be deployed to deal with the unpredictable and unexpected things the universe throws at you when you’re struggling to preserve the unity of the human race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being published online from January to April 2013 as a three-month digital serial, &lt;i&gt;The Human Division&lt;/i&gt; will appear as a full-length novel of the Old Man’s War universe, plus—for the first time in print—the first tale of Lieutenant Harry Wilson, and a coda that wasn’t part of the digital serialization.</description>\n<authors>\n<author>\n<id>4763</id>\n<name>John Scalzi</name>\n<role></role>\n<image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p5/4763.jpg]]>\n</image_url>\n<small_image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p2/4763.jpg]]>\n</small_image_url>\n<link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4763.John_Scalzi]]></link>\n<average_rating>4.00</average_rating>\n<ratings_count>429758</ratings_count>\n<text_reviews_count>34807</text_reviews_count>\n</author>\n</authors>\n  <published>2013</published>\n</book>\n\n    <book>\n  <id type=\"integer\">7081</id>\n  <isbn>0765309416</isbn>\n  <isbn13>9780765309419</isbn13>\n  <text_reviews_count type=\"integer\">979</text_reviews_count>\n  <title>The Android's Dream</title>\n  <title_without_series>The Android's Dream</title_without_series>\n  <image_url>https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png</image_url>\n  <small_image_url>https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png</small_image_url>\n  <large_image_url/>\n  <link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7081.The_Android_s_Dream</link>\n  <num_pages>396</num_pages>\n  <format></format>\n  <edition_information/>\n  <publisher></publisher>\n  <publication_day/>\n  <publication_year>2006</publication_year>\n  <publication_month>11</publication_month>\n  <average_rating>3.96</average_rating>\n  <ratings_count>12909</ratings_count>\n  <description>&lt;div&gt;A human diplomat kills his alien counterpart. Earth is on the verge of war with a vastly superior alien race. A lone man races against time and a host of enemies to find the one object that can save our planet and our people from alien enslavement...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sheep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's right, a sheep. And if you think that's the most surprising thing about this book, wait until you read Chapter One. Welcome to &lt;i&gt;The Android's Dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Harry Creek, it's quickly becoming a nightmare. All he wants is to do his uncomplicated mid-level diplomatic job with Earth's State Department. But his past training and skills get him tapped to save the planet--and to protect pet store owner Robin Baker, whose own past holds the key to the whereabouts of that lost sheep. Doing both will take him from lava-strewn battlefields to alien halls of power. All in a day's work. Maybe it's time for a raise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw in two-timing freelance mercenaries, political lobbyists with megalomaniac tendencies, aliens on a religious quest, and an artificial intelligence with unusual backstory, and you've got more than just your usual science fiction adventure story. You've got &lt;i&gt;The Android's Dream.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>\n<authors>\n<author>\n<id>4763</id>\n<name>John Scalzi</name>\n<role></role>\n<image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p5/4763.jpg]]>\n</image_url>\n<small_image_url nophoto='false'>\n<![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1407277112p2/4763.jpg]]>\n</small_image_url>\n<link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4763.John_Scalzi]]></link>\n<average_rating>4.00</average_rating>\n<ratings_count>429758</ratings_count>\n<text_reviews_count>34807</text_reviews_count>\n</author>\n</authors>\n  <published>2006</published>\n</book>\n\n    <book>\n  <id type=\"integer\">88072</id>\n  <isbn>1596060204</isbn>\n  <isbn13>9781596060203</isbn13>\n  <text_reviews_count type=\"integer\">859</text_reviews_count>\n  <title>Agent to the Stars</title>\n  <title_without_series>Agent to the Stars</title_without_series>\n  <image_url>https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1303914309m/88072.jpg</image_url>\n  <small_image_url>https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1303914309s/88072.jpg</small_image_url>\n  <large_image_url/>\n  <link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88072.Agent_to_the_Stars</link>\n  <num_pages>280</num_pages>\n  <format>Hardcover</format>\n  <edition_information/>\n  <publisher>Subterranean Press</publisher>\n  <publication_day>1</publication_day>\n  <publication_year>2005</publication_year>\n  <publication_month>8</publication_month>\n  <average_rating>3.90</average_rating>\n  <ratings_count>11880</ratings_count>\n  <description>The space-faring Yherajk have come to Earth to meet us and to begin humanity's first interstellar friendship.

Enter Thomas Stein, who knows something about closing deals. He's one of Hollywood's hottest young agents. But although Stein may have just concluded the biggest deal of his career, it's quite another thing to negotiate for an entire alien race.

The results are individual glimpses of a shared vision, and a reading experience unlike any you've had before. &lt;br /&gt;A strange man comes to an even stranger encampment...a bouncer becomes the linchpin of an unexpected urban movement...a courier on the run has to decide who to trust in a dangerous city...a slacker in a \"zero-footprint\" town gets a most unusual new job...and a weapons investigator uses his skills to discover a metropolis hidden right in front of his eyes. &lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the future of cities.
